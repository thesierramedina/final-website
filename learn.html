   Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. 
  </p>

  <p class="lh-lg">
   The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. 
  </p>

  <p class="lh-lg">
   Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.</p>

   <p class="lh-lg">
     As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe!

   Thomas Jefferson called coffee, "the favorite drink of the civilized world."
  </p>

  <p class="lh-lg">
   When it comes to caffeine content ounce by ounce, espresso wins with about 40 milligrams per ounce versus 10 milligrams per ounce in a brewed cup of coffee. However, the serving size tips the scale. A two-ounce double shot of espresso contains 80 milligrams of caffeine whilst a 12-ounce cup of brewed coffee has about 120 milligrams.
  </p>

  <p class="lh-lg">
    It may come as a surprise given the mechanized and highly efficient production methods of countries like Brazil and Vietnam that the majority of the world's coffee supply is produced by an estimated 25 million smallholder farmers. Much of the work harvesting, drying, and fermenting the coffee beans is done by hand and with great care to make the best coffee possible.

  <p class="lh-lg">
    Due to its high levels of antioxidants and beneficial nutrients like riboflavin, magnesium, and potassium, coffee may have health benefits, according to research, including a boost to your metabolic rate, increasing fat-burning potential, and a boost to your energy levels. It may also lower your risk for type-2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and certain types of cancer. However, ongoing research continues to research into these benefits.
